        <section>
            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>FROSDOT has been generously financed by the Interledger Foundation [interledger.org] as part of the Grant for the Web program. You can find a bit more history of the program here: <a href="https://interledger.org/news/getting-to-know-grant-for-the-web">https://interledger.org/news/getting-to-know-grant-for-the-web</a>. The grantee is Orcro Limited, a sister company the UK-based law firm Moorcrofts LLP. Grant for the Web has helped numerous projects to get up and running providing services on the internet, using the innovative <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetisation Protocol</a>. Web monetization is incredibly easy to implement on your web site. What not so easy is making sure that the website has the necessary terms and conditions, and privacy policies, especially if you’re hoping to trade all over the world (and why not?). Since web monetization is all about reducing friction and making it as easy as possible for buyers to buy and sellers to sell, we saw that one obstacle was obtaining and implementing appropriate legal documentation.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The base set of documents are terms and conditions for the supply of services, and relevant privacy documentation. With the help of our international partners we have developed a suite of documents designed for use across multiple jurisdictions to make compliance with legal requirements as easy as possible. We’ve also added a set of guidance documents.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The base documents have all been drafted professionally, by qualified lawyers in each jurisdiction. (But don’t try to sue them, sorry. The documents are all subject to very effective disclaimers. After all, the disclaimer were drafted professionally…)</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>Our plans</h2>
            <p>We’re aiming for FROSDOT to become the centre of a community of legal drafters and professionals who can improve the existing set of FROSDOT documents, improve them, localise them to different jurisdictions, and, over time, add new types of legal document. We’re also working hard on software to make it easier to draft, produce and customise the documents for your own purposes.</p>
