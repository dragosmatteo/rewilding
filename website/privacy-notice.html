            <h2>Why we process your personal data and the legal grounds</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>We only process your personal data if we have an appropriate reason to do so, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for the performance of a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request before entering into a contract;</li>
                <li>to comply with our legal obligations;</li>
                <li>for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party; or</li>
                <li>if you have given consent to our processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>We have a legitimate interest when we have a commercial or business reason to process your personal data, unless such reason is overridden by your own rights and interests.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a ground for processing your personal data, although we will get your consent when this is required by data protection law. We will also always ask for your consent before we process any special categories of personal data, unless we are permitted by law to process such data.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>We may only use your personal data for the purposes for which we have collected it. If we need to use it for another purpose, we will inform you about this in advance and let you know the legal ground which allows us to do so.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>We will use your personal data for the following purposes and on the following legal bases.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>On the basis of fulfilling our contract with you or to take steps before entering into contract with you at your request, in order to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>{{Contract_Standard}}</li>
                <li>{{Contract_Custom}}</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>To comply with our legal obligations, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>{{LegalO_Standard}}</li>
                <li>{{LegalO_Custom}}</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>For the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party, we may process your personal information to:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Who we share your personal data with</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>In providing our services to you, we may need to share your personal data with certain third parties listed below. Where this is the case, we only do so where this is required by law, or where we can rely on sufficient safeguards, such as an appropriate data sharing agreement. We will ensure that your personal data is only processed by any third parties for the purposes which it has been collected for and on our instructions.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We regularly share your personal data with third-party service providers whose services we use in providing our products to you. These may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>{{Disclose_Standard}}</li>
                <li>{{Disclose_Custom}}</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>{{Transfer_Safe Yes}} International transfers of your personal data</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>Where we need to transfer your personal data internationally, we will only do so if we can ensure that your personal data will be granted an appropriate level of protection. If you located in UK or EU this means that we will only do so (i) if the country we are making the transfer to is a country deemed to have an adequate level of protection in place for your personal data, or if there is no adequacy decision, (ii) if there are binding corporate rules in place, or (iii) where we have contractual arrangement with the service provider containing protections for your personal data (the EU Commission or ICO approved Standard Contractual Clauses, for example), or (iv) where the data recipient has adopted an approved code of conduct, or (v) where the data recipient has obtained certification under a certification mechanism that applies appropriate safeguards.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Please contact us if you would like further information about the mechanism used when transferring your personal data out of the EU or UK.</p>

            <h2>{{Retention_Period Yes}} How long we keep your personal data </h2>
            <br/>
            <p>We will only keep your personal data for the period of time necessary for the purpose for which we collected your personal data. For example, we will keep your personal data whilst we have an agreement with you or if we have any rights or obligations that will survive termination of the agreement (such as any payment, liability or confidentiality obligations, for example) we may process your personal data even after the agreement we had with you has ended. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>We may also keep certain information about your dealing with us for an indefinite period of time for statistical purposes if we ensure that you cannot be identified such information. Such information will not be personal data. For example, we may retain information about your order date, the products or services purchased, delivery post code, or payment method.</p>

            <h2>{{DSubrights_Yes}} Your rights</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>Under applicable data protection laws, you have a number of rights as set out below. If you would like to receive further details or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right of access: You have the right to request confirmation from us that we process your personal data and, where this is the case, information about the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the recipients of your personal data, how your personal data is protected in international transfers (if applicable) and how long your personal data will be stored. You may also request a copy of your personal data we process, but we may refuse comply with your request or comply with it partially where providing you a copy of your personal data would adversely affect the rights and freedom of others.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to rectification: You may request that we rectify any inaccurate personal data we hold about you. This also includes your right to have any incomplete data completed based on supplementary information you provide to us.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): You have the right to erasure of your personal data we process if we no longer need such personal data for the specific purpose, if you withdraw your consent on which the processing is based, if you object to our processing of your personal data and we have no overriding legitimate reasons for continued processing of your data, if we have processed your personal data unlawfully, or if we are required to erase your personal data to comply with applicable law. Following your request and where we have made your personal data publicly available, the law also requires that we take reasonable steps to erase any such data (this does not mean that we are required to ensure that anyone who has had access to your publicly available personal data and keeps copies of it removes such copies). We may be unable to satisfy your request for erasure, where we have there are legal grounds for our continued processing of your personal data, such as where the processing is necessary for our compliance with legal obligations, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to restriction of processing: You may request that we restrict the processing of your personal data where you object to or contest the accuracy of our personal data processing, or where the processing is unlawful and you request the restriction of processing as opposed to erasure of your personal data; or where we no longer need your data but it is necessary for us to keep it for the establishment, exercise or defence of your legal claims. Where you have requested that the processing of your data be restricted, we may store your data but will generally need your consent for any other use, unless applicable law permits us to do so.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to object: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data where such processing is carried out in public interest, or where it is necessary for our legitimate interest (such as for our marketing activities). Where you object to our processing of your data for marketing, we shall no longer process your personal data for such purpose.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to data portability: Where we process your personal data by automatic means or based on your consent or for performance of a contract (including for takings steps at your request before entering into a contract), you have the right to receive personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, such as in a database format. You may then transmit such data to another organisation or ask us to transmit your personal data directly to them.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to withdraw consent: Where we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you may withdraw such consent at any time. This will not affect lawfulness of our processing before your consent has been withdrawn. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right to complain: If you have any queries or concerns regarding this privacy notice or our data protection practices, please contact us. If you are not satisfied with the way we handled your query, you have the right lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making: Where we engage processes that automatically make decisions based on your personal data (such as profiling), we are required to inform you about the logic of such decision-making, as well as about the significance and consequences of the decisions made in this way. Unless such automated decision-making has been authorised by a relevant public authority, or you have given us your consent for it, or it is necessary for entering into or for the performance of a contract between us, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal data, including profiling.
